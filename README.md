# Vario Boxy 2.1 / Feb 2017

**Important Note**
This project is no longer maintained.

## What is it?
A combination of two libraries we made, and some tools made by others which we commonly use. It helps us get started more quickly on a project by automating some common things. It's basically an inital set up for small-medium sized projects that don't require a CMS, yet need to load ultra-fast and therefore jQuery isn't ideal. Up to 50% of users click away if a page hasn't loaded in three seconds - so for many projects every fraction of a second counts. 

## What's VarioJS?
Glad you asked. It's the JavaScript library. It's a project I'm working on at the moment. It includes ready made functions for some common things I do in JavaScript, like updating content on the page, fading something in/out, making an AJAX request, lazy loading scripts, etc. You can see more here: https://vario2.andreobriennz.com 

## Standard Features (linked to and set up by default - remove links from footer if not needed): 
- CSS: Skeleton / Normalize
- JS: jQuery / VarioJS (library) 
- PHP: templating 
- .htaccess: basic set up (read, understand and customize to the site before publishing)

## Optional Extras (included in the file, just add link to these if needed):
- CSS: Vario colour and font library (the files are there but not linked to by default)

## Possible future stuff:
- JS: Vario SPA templating / router
- PHP Mailer basic set up
- Optional set up for react as we use it more often
- Optional links to greensock cdn for animated sites that need more than jQuery

## Removed:
- Vario grid (We now tend to use other frameworks such as Skeleton instead)
